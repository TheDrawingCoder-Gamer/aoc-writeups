# 2021

2021 is a special year. It's when I started doing advent of code, and it started in early 2022. This is also when I first
started writing Scala, but mostly I wrote Haskell. As a special treat, I'll transpose both solutions I've written -
one written in Haskell all the way back in 2022 (with modifications if it has odd naming, and to make
it better match the flow of the Scala side) and a Scala version written in December of 2024.
