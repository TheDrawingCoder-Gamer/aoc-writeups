# 2021

2021 is a special year. It's when I started doing advent of code, and it started in early 2022. This is also when I first
started writing scala, but mostly I wrote haskell. As a special treat, I'll transpose both solutions I've written -
one written in haskell all the way back in 2022 (with modifications if it has odd naming, and to make
it better match the flow of the scala side) and one written in December of 2024.
