# 2020

This was the year of haxe for me, so the beginning days were written in Haxe.
There are other languages mixed in there, including Ruby and the obsolete CoffeeScript.

I'll update my Haxe and Ruby solutions to fit into writeups, but I'm not going to bother with CoffeeScript.
It's based on JS which I have a severe dislike of, so it'll be just a scala solution those days.
