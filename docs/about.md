# About

Mostly Scala 3, with some other languages scattered in.

I have installed cats-core as well, and many solutions use it. I probably
won't declare when I do use it, so if you can't find it in std it's probably
in cats core.

I also have a common library that includes some helpers for 2d points, int math,
directions, and grids. Depending on when a page was written I may explicitly
rewrite a common library class/function and include it. Other pages I may just state "this is from my common library." You can view the general library code 
[here](https://github.com/TheDrawingCoder-Gamer/adventofcode2024/tree/master/core/shared/src/main/scala/gay/menkissing/common).
