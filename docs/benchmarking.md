# Benchmarking

Some of these pages have benchmarks listed. Here's some info on what they mean:

I use a custom benchmarker across JVM, JS, and Native that warms up 3 times then takes 3 measurements.
It forks for every single benchmark (except on native, afaik native doesn't require forking to get good results).
